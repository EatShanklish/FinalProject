Job Search Engine Aggregator

We did a lot of great things during our time at Grand Circus but for the most part, we wrote code and applied for jobs. Late nights, 12 different tabs, 5 different job search engines.

Now, there are dozens of job search engines. Monster, Indeed, Dice, Craigslist, Angellist, and so much more. Each with their own variations and experiences that revolve around one key function, harvesting job listings. Employers of all sizes, Fortune 500 and startups - all use one or more of these websites to list openings and opportunities at their company.

Whichever job search engine you find yourself on, you'll enter a few keywords, peruse through their lists of job postings and be redirected to the employer's website where you can apply for the position. 

We don't do that at Jobify. While job search engines aggregate job postings, we aggregate job seach engines. When you search for a position on Jobify, you're simulatenously searching through Dice, Monster,Indeed and more.

--DEMO THE WEBSITE--

So, at first glance, Jobify might seem like just a convenient way to find a job but we did our homework and found out a little more. By searching "Java" and "Detroit" on Dice, Indeed and Monster - we came back with some interesting results. 

So, what if you were only aware of one of these job sites? Would you be missing out?

After comparing 100 job postings from each site, we found that there were only 17 duplicated postings. Out of 300 listings, 17 were the exact same position. That means that there are 283 unique job postings dispersed between the three.[Need Accurate estimations]

Yes, you would be missing out.

At Jobify, when you're looking for a job, we combine all the listings from over 4 different engines, eliminate the duplicates and present them to you in one endless page. No tabs, no extra windows.

You can bookmark jobs, view your recent history, and filter your listings by location, company and search engine.
